## The actually important shits

### What's FNF♯?

FNF♯ is the spiritual successor to UFNF and NUFNF however if you prefer NUFNF i recommend checking out Sublime Engine by @SpunBlue which runs on the NUFNF codebase.

### What makes it better than (N)UFNF?

The Input system for the most part. FNF♯'s input system is distance-based, which means it calculates your rating based on the distance from the notes to the strumline in pixels while most other input systems are based on the timing of the song. Also, unlike (N)UFNF, FNF♯ is cross-platform being available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
